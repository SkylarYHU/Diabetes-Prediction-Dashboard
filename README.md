# Diabetes Prediction Dashboard

A Streamlit app that predicts diabetes risk using an XGBoost model. Itâ€™s designed for learning and demonstration, combining interactive predictions with basic fairness analysis.

## Live Demo

## What You Can Do
- Adjust inputs in the sidebar and click Predict to see diabetes risk.

- Explore how the threshold affects results with a simple slider.

- Check the Fairness page to visualize model performance by gender and smoking history.

## How to Run
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  streamlit run app.py
```

Then open it in your browser â€” youâ€™ll see a default prediction first, and you can test your own inputs anytime.

## Tech Behind It

- Streamlit for the dashboard

- XGBoost for binary classification

- Altair for visualizations

- Python 3.10+

## Why I Built It

This project started as a way to explore how machine learning can support health-related insights â€” and how fairness plays a role in prediction models.
